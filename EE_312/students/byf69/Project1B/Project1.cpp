/* You must write this function (spellCheck). Do not change the way the function is declared (i.e., it has
 * exactly two parameters, each parameter is a standard (mundane) C string (see SpellCheck.pdf).
 * You are expected to use reasonable programming style. I *insist* that you indent 
 * reasonably and consistently in your code. I strongly encourage you to avoid big functions
 * (while there are always exceptions, a good rule of thumb is about 15 lines in a function).
 * So, plan on implementing spellCheck by writing two or three other "support functions" that
 * help make the actual spell checking easier for you.
 * There are no explicit restictions on using functions from the C standard library. However,
 * for this project you should avoid using functionality from the C++ standard libary. You will
 * almost certainly find it easiest to just write everything you need from scratch!
